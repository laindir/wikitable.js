#wikitable.js

Relational joins of Wikipedia comparison tables

This was a quick hack I threw together when searching for an IRCd with specific
features. I was tired of importing Wikipedia tables into a database in order to
be able to filter them in a sane way. I hope you find it useful.

##TODO

* Improve reliability/predictability of getText
* Handle the Wikipedia splits wide tables
* Make it generally less awful
* Don't pollute the global namespace
* Render to HTML table?
* Make it work on tables outside of Wikipedia
